# klaviyo-api-functions
A collection of functions for using various Klaviyo API endpoints.

### Keep in mind a couple of caveats
- Everything here is very specific to the needs of one project, so you most likely won't find something for your specific needs, but may find some helpful ideas
- Some of the functions can be used independently and some work together. They were all originally part of the same file.

This file is mostly here for my own future reference, but it's public in the case that something in it can shine a light on someone else's frustrating problem. I know there were a couple of nuances in the Klaviyo API that frustrated me to no end, such as the need to already know internal Klaviyo IDs that a given piece of code had no way to know without some significant local database additions or hard-coding.
